            <div class="border border-width"></div>
            <p class="pt-3">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. </p>
            <p>AI means machine thinking as humans. These AI machines have the ability to chnage their algorithm. One of the best examples for AI would be Robo movie. </p>
            <p>Facebook has two AI robots which are now shut down as they both started talking with each other in their own language, which humans can't understand. It is good to have a technology like AI but it's a disadvantage if we don't know how to control it.</p>

                   <p class="pt-2"> These Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to solve one single problem and would be able to execute a single task really well. By definition, they have narrow capabilities, like recommending a product for an e-commerce user or predicting the weather.</p>

                <p class="pt-2">  Itâ€™s defined as AI which has a human-level of cognitive function, across a wide variety of domains such as language processing, image processing, computational functioning and reasoning and so on.   </p>

                <p class="pt-2">   An Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) system would be able to surpass all human capabilities. This would include decision making, taking rational decisions, and even includes things like making better art and building emotional relationships.</p>
